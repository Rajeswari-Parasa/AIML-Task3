# AI & ML Internship – Task 3

## Task Title
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand
data patterns, distributions, relationships between features, and identify important
features for machine learning.

## Datasets Used
- Iris Dataset
- Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Task Description
In this task, EDA techniques were applied to analyze both numerical and categorical
features. Various visualizations such as histograms, count plots, box plots, and
correlation heatmaps were used to understand data behavior and relationships.

## Key Steps Performed
- Loaded and inspected datasets
- Plotted histograms for numerical feature distributions
- Used count plots for categorical feature analysis
- Identified outliers using box plots
- Analyzed feature relationships using correlation heatmaps
- Identified important features for prediction
- Summarized insights from visualizations

## Key Insights
- Iris dataset petal features show strong correlation and are important for classification
- Some numerical features contain outliers
- Netflix dataset contains more movies than TV shows
- Visualization helped identify trends and patterns clearly

## Outcome
This task helped in understanding data patterns, detecting outliers, and identifying
important features, which are essential steps before building machine learning models.
